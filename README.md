## Overview
The APIpeanuts framework is a Python-based solution designed to enable Python package developers to easily monetize their applications. This framework integrates a pay-per-use model using FastAPI, Supabase, Stripe, and Heroku, providing a seamless experience for both package developers and their end users.

## Objectives
- To provide a simple and efficient way for Python developers to monetize their packages.
- To abstract the complexities of payment processing, user authentication, and credit management.

## Features
- **API Key Management**: Secure generation and management of API keys for user authentication.
- **Credit System**: A robust credit purchasing and management system integrated with Stripe.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple decorators for Python functions to enable pay-per-use features.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Utilizing FastAPI and Heroku for high performance and scalability.

## Target Audience
- Individual Python developers or hobbyists.
- Small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) developing Python packages.
- Open-source project maintainers looking for monetization solutions.
- Indie Hackers 

## Project Structure
The project is divided into several key components:
- **FastAPI Backend**: Manages API requests, user authentication, and communicates with Supabase for data storage.
- **Supabase Database**: Stores user data, API keys, and transaction records.
- **Stripe Integration**: Handles payment processing and credit allocation.
- **Python Package Integration**: A simple interface for package developers to integrate monetization into their packages.
